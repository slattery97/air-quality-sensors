# air-quality-sensors
This project was developed as a part of an undergraduate engineering project through Purdue University. The purpose of this project was to develop an R program that generates an optimal network of air quality sensors for a given region and budget using machine learning and linear programming. The R program links to a SQL database that stores the GPS locations of the air quality sensors and a website that displays the sensor locations on a map.
